# Git Freestyle

Our Git/GitHub intro went down like a lead balloon during HiPy 02. With hindsight, trying to brainwash you all into using Git immediately was probably never going to end well. Oh Well, you live, you learn.

Instead, we invite you to explore Git on your own terms. We know that the time will come when you won't be able to live without it. This challenge gets you to invent your own challenge and submit it to the Hive via Git and GitHub. Make sure you provide a solution to your challenge (with comments) that people can follow.

## Objectives

  + Install Git locally
  + Create a GitHub account
  + Fork [https://github.com/hipyliv/micro-challenges](https://github.com/hipyliv/micro-challenges)
  + Clone the repository from your GitHub account to a local directory
  + Create a new challenge (keep it simple, but relevant to your own field)
  + Add a solution to the solutions branch
  + Commit and Push master and solutions branches to your repo
  + Make a Pull request to the original hipyliv/micro-challenges repo
  + Phew!
