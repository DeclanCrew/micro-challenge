Using test modules:

I've added test modules to two of the challenges - numeral converter, and palindrome checker.
These modules provide a way to test a wide variety of cases very quickly. Simply run the test
module (e.g "python numeral_test.py" on the command-line) to see if your script works as
intended.

These tests are written in Python, so make sure to have a read of the code and try to 
understand how they are working.
