# Palindrome Checker

The word palindrome isn't a palindrome. Unfortunately, fear of palindromes is: Aibohphobia. This challenge is to create a function that will check a word to see if it is a palindrome.

## Objectives

  + Write a function that returns a boolean depending on whether an input word is a palindrome or not
  + Make your function work regardless of capitalisation
  + Make your function work even with sentences e.g. "Now saw ye no mosses or foam, or aroma of roses. So money was won."
